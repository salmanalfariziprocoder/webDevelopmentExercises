          Is high school too early to set up a LinkedIn profile? Absolutely not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now is the perfect time for you to invest in an online presence on
          LinkedIn. High school students who create a LinkedIn profile will
          stand apart from the competition and have an advantage as you start on
          your path to a successful career.
        </p>

        <p>
          Begin by creating a LinkedIn profile that showcases who you are, what
          you have achieved, and what your goals and interests are. From there,
          you can use the platform to start building professional relationships
          that will be an invaluable asset as you plan for your future.

          The more sections you complete the better, but as a high school
          student, you wonâ€™t be able to use every section. Just be as
          professional and thorough as possible in the areas you do choose to
          complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some tips to help you ensure you create a strong profile that
          will serve you:

      <article class="checklistArticle">
        <section class="checklistSectionPhoto">
          <div class="subTopicHeader">
            <h2><i class="fa-regular fa-user"></i> Photos</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="subTopicContent">
            <div>
              <input type="checkbox" />
              <p>
                Use a headshot where you are dressed professionally, in the kind
                of clothes you would wear for an interview.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <input type="checkbox" />
              <p>
                Crop the photo close to your head, so people can see your face.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <input type="checkbox" />
              <p>
                Use a background header that tells something about you: a photo
                of you participating in an event, your city, your school, or
                photo that illustrates the kind of career you want.

              Include your planned major or course of study, career goal, and

              in. For example:
